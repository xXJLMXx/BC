    <div class="box">
  
    
<p>THIS NOTICE DESCRIBES HOW MEDICAL INFORMATION ABOUT YOU MAY BE USED AND DISCLOSED BY THE BAKERSFIELD COLLEGE STUDENT HEALTH CENTER AND HOW YOU CAN GET ACCESS TO THIS INFORMATION.</p>

<p align="center">PLEASE READ IT CAREFULLY</p>

<p align="center"><u>Effective Date: October 14, 2003</u></p>

<p>Under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPPA) Privacy regulations, the Bakersfield College Student Health and Wellness Center and all similar health care providers are required by federal law to maintain the privacy of your protected health information (PHI) and will abide by the terms of this Privacy Notice.</p>

<p>Please be advised that the Student Health and Wellness Center may use your PHI in rendering treatment to you. For example, we are permitted to use your PHI in providing you with medical care/treatment when you visit our office. Under federal law, we may disclose your PHI to you or we can disclose your PHI to third parties for treatment. For example, if we refer you to a specialist, we will forward your medical information to such specialist. We may disclose your PHI for payment purposes. For example, we may disclose your PHI to your insurance provider, employer, or other party responsible for providing you with health insurance coverage in order for the Student Health and Wellness Center to be reimbursed for our services rendered to you. We may also use or disclose your PHI for health care operations. For example, we may use your PHI when we engage in quality assurance and medical chart reviews, which are part of our health care operations. We may also disclose your PHI when required by the Secretary of The US Department of Health and Human Services.</p>

<p>Unless disclosure is required under federal, state law, or certain other exceptions, including law enforcement, we are prohibited from disclosing your PHI without your authorization. Our practice may use or disclose your PHI in accordance with the specific requirements of the HIPAA rules without the Student Health and Wellness Center needing to obtain your authorization if the information is:</p>

      <br/>
      
<ol>
	<li>Required by law.</li>
	<li>Required for public health purpose.</li>
	<li>Required for disclosures about victims of abuse, neglect or domestic violence.</li>
	<li>Required by a health oversight agency for oversight activities authorized by law.</li>
	<li>Required in the course of any judicial or administrative proceeding.</li>
	<li>Required for a law enforcement purpose to law enforcement official.</li>
	<li>Required by a coroner or medical examiner.</li>
	<li>Required by an organ procurement organization for research.</li>
	<li>If disclosure is necessary to prevent or lessen a serious and imminent threat to the health or safety of a person or the public.</li>
</ol>
      <br/>

<p>Additionally, if you are a member of the armed forces, the Bakersfield College Student Health and Wellness Center is permitted to disclose your PHI without your consent if deemed necessary by appropriate military command to assure an appropriate military mission.</p>

<p>We may also contact you via mail or phone to remind you of appointments with our office or to discuss treatment alternatives.</p>

<p>In the event our practice wishes to disclose your PHI to another entity besides those referenced above, we are required to obtain your authorization. We would seek to obtain your authorization if the Student Health and Wellness Center desired to release your PHI for reasons other than treatment, payment, or our practice's operations. For example, if we desired to participate in outside research or a drug study, we would need your written authorization prior to being permitted to release your PHI to such outside research facility or drug manufacturer. If you provide us with an authorization, you have the ability to revoke such authorization at any time by sending the Student Health and Wellness Center a written revocation.</p>

<p>Please be further advised that you have the ability to access, copy, and inspect and amend your medical information that we maintain. Additionally, if you desire, the Student Health and Wellness Center can provide you with an accounting of all disclosures of your PHI for treatment, payment or healthcare operations.</p>

<p>If you have a dispute with our practice regarding our use of your PHI or a disclosure by the Student Health and Wellness Center and believe that your primary rights have been violated, please contact the Dean of Students. Please understand that the Student Health and Wellness Center will not retaliate against you in any way for filing a complaint.</p>

<p>Lastly, please be advised that you have the right to request restrictions on certain use and disclosures of your PHI to carry out treatment, payment or healthcare operations or disclosures by the Student Health and Wellness Center of your PHI to a family member, relative, or a close personal friend. However, we are not required by federal law to agree to your requested restriction. If you request a copy of your PHI, you also have the ability to request that we send it to an alternative location (different address) and by alternative means. Bakersfield College Student Health and Wellness Center reserves the right to amend this Notice as revised. Notices will be posted on our website and in our offices and provided to you upon request.</p>
